To run all files currently included in src/, one should follow these steps:

1. Create an empty directory: 'data/'
2. Install the psi4 electronic structure package.
3. Add fermilib/src to your pypath.
4. Make sure you have latest version of scipy.

To contribute code please adhere to the following very simple rules:

1. Make sure your new code comes with extensive tests!
2. Make sure your new code passes all tests and lint checks by running:
   python -m pytest
3. Make sure you adhere to our style guide. Just look at our code for clues.
   Mostly, we follow pep8 and use the pep8 linter with the following
   modifications in the pep8 ~/.config/pep8 file: ignore = E111, E114, E226
4. Sort the imports alphabetically, and the 'import foo' block comes before
   the 'from bar import foo' block.
5. Put global constants and configuration parameters into src/config.py, and
   add 'from config import *' in the file that uses the constants/parameters.
