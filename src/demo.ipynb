    "## FermionTerm data structure for local fermionic operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Fermionic systems are often treated in second quantization where arbitrary operators can be expressed using the fermionic creation and annihilation operators, $a^\\dagger_k$ and $a_k$.  The fermionic ladder operators play a similar role to their qubit ladder operator counterparts, $\\sigma^+_k$ and $\\sigma^-_k$ but are distinguished by the cannonical fermionic anticommutation relations, $\\{a^\\dagger_i, a^\\dagger_j\\} = \\{a_i, a_j\\} = 0$ and $\\{a_i, a_j^\\dagger\\} = \\delta_{ij}$, also known as the Pauli exclusion principle. A \"local fermionic operator\" is defined here as a product of fermionic creation and annihilation operators with an associated (complex) scalar coefficient. For instance, $-1.7 \\, a^\\dagger_3 a_1$, $(1 + 2i) \\, a^\\dagger_4 a^\\dagger_3 a_9 a_1$ and $0.8\\, a_3 a_{11}$ are all perfectly valid examples of local fermionic operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representation of these operators using the FermionTerm data structure is at the very heart of FermiLib. The FermionTerm class is part of the fermion_operators.py module. Because FermionTerms share the same basic structure as QubitTerms (which we introduce later on in this demo), both classes inherit most of their functionality from the LocalTerm parent class which is found in the module local_terms.py. FermionTerm objects store three important attributes: the number of sites on which the term acts (n_qubits), the scalar coefficient of the term (coefficient) and a python list which specifies the operators in the term (terms). The terms list is a list of 2-tuples which represent the $a^\\dagger_k$ / $a_k$ ladder operators with the first element is an int giving the site on which the term acts and the second element is Boole indicating whether the operator is $a^\\dagger$ (1), or $a$ (0). For instance, $[(3, 1), (7, 0)]$ represents $a_3^\\dagger a_7$. Note that the \"terms\" attribute associated with the identity operator is an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, we import FermionTerm and initialize a few example terms. We show that terms can be manipulated in an intuitive way using python operators such as $*=$, $==$, $!=$, len, abs. The slice, get, set and iteration methods are redirected to the .terms attribute; for instance, FermionTerm[2] returns the third element of the .terms attribute. The print and repr methods are overloaded to show a convenient human-readable representation. The methods .hermitian_conjugate() (an in-place method) and .hermitian_conjugated() (returns a copy) act on the term $T$ to return $T^\\dagger$. Note that this convention of methods that end in \"ed\" returning copies whereas methods without \"ed\" being in-place occurs throughout the library. We also show a quick way to initialize identity operators and number operators. See the code documentation for further details."

    "The FermionOperator data structure represents arbitrary sums of FermionTerm objects.

Like FermionTerm, FermionOperator inherits from a more general parent class which it shares with QubitOperator, LocalOperator, which is found in the module local_operator.py. The FermionOperator data structure is implemented as a wrapper to a python dictionary. Internally, the keys for this dictionary are the .terms attribute of a the FermionTerm object and the values are the .coefficient attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize a FermionOperator one should pass n_qubits, followed by a list of FermionTerms. Alternatively, a sum or difference of FermionTerms automatically returns a FermionOperator. The FermionOperator supports many built-in operands from the python data model such as $+$, $-$, $+=$, $-=$, $*$, $**$, $==$, $!=$, abs, print, iter (aka \"in\"), len, and del. FermionOperator is implement as a dictionary is so that terms can be quickly added to the class. Note that one can set or look up the coefficient of a term in a FermionOperator by passing an instance of FermionTerm to the slice operator [] of FermionOperator."

Note that the normal-ordering method on FermionTerm automatically returns a FermionOperator, not a FermionTerm, as in general the normal-ordered form of a FermionTerm is a sum of FermionTerms. Note that unless normal-ordering is strictly required for a complex routine, FermiLib is designed to never normal-order automatically. This is because normal-ordering is foramlly an exponentially expensive routine. So we want users to manually call normal-ordering so they know that it is occuring."

A key difference between FermionTerm and QubitTerm is that the .terms attribute of QubitTerm differs from the .terms attribute of FermionTerm. Specifically, where 0 and 1 encode $a^\\dagger$ and $a$ operators in FermionTerm, $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ Pauli operators are encoded by those strings. For instance, for the term mentioned above, the .terms attribute would be [(1, 'X'), (7, 'Y'), (12, 'Z')]. Note that while the .terms attribute of FermionTerm is not necessarily sorted by orbital index, the .term attribute of QubitTerm is always sorted by tensor factor. This allows for asymptotically faster term multiplication.\n",

    "## Basics of MolecularData class and making a chemical series\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most useful features in FermiLib concern its interaction with open source electronic structure packages. Currently, we have support only for Psi4 but by release date we will also support Garnet Chan's pyscf which has many useful routines that Psi4 does not including plane wave codes, codes for DMET and very optimized DMRG routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from electronic structure calculations is generated using FermiLib scripts which perform the calculations and then populate a FermiLib data structure called MolecularData. Very often, one would like to analyze a chemical series or look at many different Hamiltonians and sometimes the electronic structure calculations are either expensive to compute or difficult to converge (e.g. one needs to mess around with different types of SCF routines to make things converge). Accordingly, we anticipate that users will want some way to automatically databse the results of their electronic structure calculations so that important data (such as the SCF intergrals) can be looked up on-the-fly if the user has computed them in the past. The first release of FermiLib will support a data provenance strategy which saves key results of the electronic structure calculation (including pointers to files containing large amounts of data, such as the molecular integrals) in the HDF5 container. However, integration with HDf5 is still under construction so for now we are pickling the MolecularData class. We view pickling as bad engineering for several reasons including security issues, speed, and issues with Python 3 compatibility. So be warned: the wave electronic structure calculations are automatically databased is going to change over the next month!\n",
    "\n",
    "The MolecularData class stores information about molecules. One initializes a MolecularData object by specifying key parameters of a molecule such as its geometry, basis, multiplicity, charge and an optional string describing it. Unless the optional autosave argument of the MolecularData initialization function is explicitly passed as \"False\", the generation of a MolecularData object will automatically save the MolecularData object (in either HDf5 or pickle). When electronic structure calculations are run on that molecule, the data files for the molecule are automatically updated. For instance, once one runs an FCI calculation on the molecule, the attribute MolecularData.fci_energy will be saved and set equal the FCI energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis functions are based to initialization using a string such as \"6-31g\". Geometries can be specified using a simple txt input file (see geometry_from_file function in molecular_data.py) or can be passed using a simple python list format demonstrated below. Atoms are specified using a string for their atomic symbol. Distances should be provided in atomic units (Bohr). Below we initialize a simple instance of MolecularData without performing any electronic structure calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also demonstrate some functionality is the simple helper module, chemical_series.py. A chemical series is a progression of larger and larger molecules. Often, it is interesting to study chemical series because one can extrapolate the performance a method to a regime that is difficult to simulate. We demonstrate how two functions from chemical_series.py can be used make hydrogen rings or single atoms with the current spin multiplicity."

    "## Running psi4 to populate the MolecularData class\n",
    "\n",
    "The module run_psi4.py provides a user-friendly way of running psi4 calculations in FermiLib. The basic idea is that once one generates a MolecularData instance, one can then call psi4 with a specification of certain options (for instance, how much memory to use and what calculations to do) in order to compute things about the molecule, update the MolecularData object, and save results of the calculation. The most common calculations users will want in FermiLib would probably be self-consistent field (aka Hartree-Fock calculations). Our code uses these \"SCF\" calculations compute orbitals, integrals, Hartree-Fock energy, and more. Other common calculations are CISD and FCI calculations which also compute the 1-RDM and 2-RDM associated with their answers, CCSD calculations which also compute the CCSD amplitudes (useful for UCC) and MP2 calculations which can also be used to UCCSD initial guesses. \n",
    "Note that the \"delete_input\" and \"delete_output\" options indicate whether to save automatically generated psi4 input files or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is because psi4 has a GPL license that the only code which interacts with psi4 is run_psi4.py. In order to avoid license contamination we actually use python code to generate an input file for psi4 using psi4_template. Python code in psi4_template instructs psi4 (not python) to load the MolecularData object, populate it with information from calculations and then save the MolecularData object as a pickle or (eventually HDF5). The module run_psi4 uses subprocess to actually run_psi4 and then loads the pickled MolecularData. Let us look at a simple example where we compute the energy of H$_2$ at various bond lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warnings: electronic structure calculations are finicky. They sometimes fail for surprising reasons. If a particular calculation is not converging it is probably necessary to change some of the SCF options set in psi4_template. See the Psi4 documentation for more information or consult and electronic structure theory expert."

    "## MolecularOperator for molecular Hamiltonians and RDMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular Hamiltonians can be expressed as $H = h_0 + \\sum_{pq} h_{pq}\\, a^\\dagger_p a_q + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{pqrs} h_{pqrs} \\, a^\\dagger_p a^\\dagger_q a_r a_s$ where $h_0$ is a constant shift due to the nuclear repulsion and $h_{pq}$ and $h_{pqrs}$ are the famous molecular integrals. Since fermions interact pairwise, their energy is thus a unique function of the one-particle and two-particle reduced density matrices which are expressed in second quantization as $\\rho_{pq} = \\left \\langle p \\mid a^\\dagger_p a_q \\mid q \\right \\rangle$ and $\\rho_{pqrs} = \\left \\langle pq \\mid a^\\dagger_p a_q \\mid rs \\right \\rangle$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both the RDMs and molecular Hamiltonians are both compactly represented and manipulated as 2- and 4- index tensors, we represent them using the same MolecularOperator data structure. The MolecularOperator data structure can be initialized for a Hamiltonian (or RDM) by passing the constant $h_0$ (or 0), as well as numpy arrays representing $h_{pq}$ (or $\\rho_{pq}$) and $h_{pqrs}$ (or $\\rho_{pqrs}$). Importantly, MolecularOperators can also be obtained by calling MolecularData.get_molecular_hamiltonian(), MolecularData.get_molecular_rdm(), or FermionOperator.get_molecular_operator(). When generating RDMs or Hamiltonians from the MolecularData class, one can also choose to restrict the system to an active space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MolecularOperator data structure overloads the slice operator [] so that one can get or set the key attributes of the MolecularOperator: .constant, .one_body_coefficients and .two_body_coefficients. For instance, MolecularOperator[p,q,r,s] would return $h_{pqrs}$ or $\\rho_{pqrs}$. It also supports binary operators !=, ==. Importantly, the class supports fast basis transformations using the method MolecularOperator.rotate_basis(rotation_matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "But perhaps most importantly, one can map the MolecularOperator to any of the other data structures we've described here. The generation of a QubitOperator representation of the MolecularOperator using the Jordan-Wigner transformation is shown below. Finally, note that more changes are coming to this class that will make it easier to work with."
