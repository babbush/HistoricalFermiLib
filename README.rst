FermiLib is an open source effort for analyzing quantum simulation algorithms.

The first version (v0.1a0) is an alpha release which features data structures and tools for obtaining and manipulating representations of fermionic Hamiltonians. FermiLib is designed as a library of ProjectQ and leverages ProjectQ to compile, emulate and simulate quantum circuits. FermiLib supports plug-ins from third party electronic structure packages in order to perform certain calculations.

Getting started
---------------

To start using FermiLib, simply follow the installation instructions in the `intro <https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/FermiLib/tree/master/docs/intro.html>`__. There, you will also find `code examples <https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/FermiLib/tree/master/examples.html>`__. Also, make sure to check out the `ProjectQ
website <http://www.projectq.ch>`__ and the detailed `code documentation <https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/FermiLib/tree/master/docs/>`__.

How to contribute
-----------------

To contribute code please adhere to the following very simple rules:

1. Make sure your new code comes with extensive tests!
2. Make sure you adhere to our style guide. Just look at our code for clues.
   Mostly, we follow pep8 and use the pep8 linter with the following
   modifications in the pep8 ~/.config/pep8 file: ignore = E111, E114, E226
3. Make sure your new code passes all tests and lint checks by running:
   ./precommit_tests
4. Sort the imports alphabetically, and the 'import foo' block comes before
   the 'from bar import foo' block.
5. Put global constants and configuration parameters into src/config.py, and
   add 'from config import *' in the file that uses the constants/parameters.
