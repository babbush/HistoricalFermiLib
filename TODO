*********************************
* STRICTLY NECESSARY FOR LAUNCH *
*********************************

Move to HDF5 data structure for MolecularData instead of pickle.
- Damian

Fix bug with expectation values of RDMs with odd electrons.
- Jarrod

Add support for pyscf.
- Ryan

Add Bravyi-Kitaev transformation.
- James or Vojtech

Integrate with ProjectQ and finish documentation.
- Damian or Thomas

Write paper about ProjectQ implementation.
- Ryan, Jarrod, Damian and Thomas

Add routines to extract coupled cluster coefficients to psi4_template.
- Damian or Jarrod

Finish ipython notebook demo.
- Ryan

Make the MolecularOperator data structure more integrated with python
data model. For instance, support the __print__ method to quickly print
out Hamiltonians in a human readable way.
- Ryan


*************************************************
* OPTIONAL THINGS THAT ARE PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA *
*************************************************

Make MolecularOperator two data structures, one for RDMs
and one for Hamiltonians, which inherit from the same parent class.
- Ryan

Make sparse_operators.py encapsulated by a class.
- Ryan or Jarrod

Make faster routines to check commutivity of qubit operators.
- Ryan

Make important and costly routines like normal-ordering faster with C++.
- Thomas

Add routines to prepare simple UCC circuits.
- Damian or Ryan

Improved performance routines for generating sparse operators.
- Jarrod or Thomas

Reverse Bravyi-Kitaev representation.
- James or Vojtech

More generalized fermionic mappings.
- James or Vojtech

Add parser for our Fermion/Qubit language.
- Jarrod
