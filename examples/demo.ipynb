    "## Initializing the FermionOperator data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Fermionic systems are often treated in second quantization where arbitrary operators can be expressed using the fermionic creation and annihilation operators, $a^\\dagger_k$ and $a_k$.  The fermionic ladder operators play a similar role to their qubit ladder operator counterparts, $\\sigma^+_k$ and $\\sigma^-_k$ but are distinguished by the cannonical fermionic anticommutation relations, $\\{a^\\dagger_i, a^\\dagger_j\\} = \\{a_i, a_j\\} = 0$ and $\\{a_i, a_j^\\dagger\\} = \\delta_{ij}$. Any weighted sums of products of these operators are represented with the FermionOperator data structure in FermiLib. The following are examples of valid FermionOperators:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "& a_1 \\\\\n",
    "& 1.7 a^\\dagger_3\\\\\n",
    "&-1.7 \\, a^\\dagger_3 a_1\\\\\n",
    "&(1 + 2i) \\, a^\\dagger_4 a^\\dagger_3 a_9 a_1\\\\\n",
    "&(1 + 2i) \\, a^\\dagger_4 a^\\dagger_3 a_9 a_1 - 1.7 \\, a^\\dagger_3 a_1\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The FermionOperator class is contained in $\\textrm{ops/_fermion_operators.py}$. In order to support fast addition of FermionOperator instances, the class is implemented as hash table (python dictionary). The keys of the dictionary encode the strings of ladder operators and values of the dictionary store the coefficients. The strings of ladder operators are encoded as a tuple of 2-tuples which we refer to as the \"terms tuple\". Each ladder operator is represented by a 2-tuple. The first element of the 2-tuple is an int indictating the tensor factor on which the ladder operator acts. The second element of the 2-tuple is Boole: 1 represents raising and 0 represents lowering. For instance, $a^\\dagger_8$ is represented in a 2-tuple as $(8, 1)$. Note that indices start at 0 and the identity operator is an empty list. Below we give some examples of operators and their terms tuple:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "I & \\mapsto ()\\\\\n",
    "a_1 & \\mapsto ((1, 0),)\\\\\n",
    "a^\\dagger_3 & \\mapsto ((3, 1),)\\\\\n",
    "a^\\dagger_3 a_1 & \\mapsto ((3, 1), (1, 0))\\\\\n",
    "a^\\dagger_4 a^\\dagger_3 a_9 a_1 & \\mapsto ((4, 1), (3, 1), (9, 0), (1, 0))\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Note that when initializing a single ladder operator one should be careful to add the comma after the inner pair. This is because in python ((1, 2)) = (1, 2) whereas ((1, 2),) = ((1, 2),). The \"terms tuple\" is usually convenient when one wishes to initialize a term as part of a coded routine. However, the terms tuple is not particularly intuitive. Accordingly, FermiLib also supports another user-friendly, string notation below. This representation is rendered when calling \"print\" on a FermionOperator.\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "I & \\mapsto \"\"\\\\\n",
    "a_1 & \\mapsto \"1\"\\\\\n",
    "a^\\dagger_3 & \\mapsto \"3\\textrm{^}\"\\\\\n",
    "a^\\dagger_3 a_1 & \\mapsto \"3\\textrm{^} \\,\\, 1\"\\\\\n",
    "a^\\dagger_4 a^\\dagger_3 a_9 a_1 & \\mapsto \"4\\textrm{^}\\,\\, 3\\textrm{^} \\,\\, 9 \\,\\,1\"\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Let's initialize our first term! We do it two different ways below."

    "The preferred way to specify the coefficient in FermiLib is to provide an optional coefficient argument. If not provided, the coefficient defaults to 1. The first method is preferred. The multiplication in the last method actually creates a copy of the term, which introduces some additional cost. All inplace operands (such as +=) modify classes where as operands such as + create copies. Important caveats are that the empty tuple FermionOperator(()) or the empty string FermionOperator('') initializes identity. Whereas an empty initializer FermionOperator() initializes the zero operator. We demonstrate some of these things below."

FermionOperators also support a wide range of builtins including, str(), repr(), *=, *, /, /=, +, +=, -, -=, - and **.

As the name suggests, QubitOperator is used to store qubit operators in almost exactly the same way that FermionOperator is used to store fermion operators. For instance $X_0 Z_3 Y_4$ is a QubitOperator. The internal representation of this as a terms tuple would be $((0, X), (3, Z), (4, Y))$.

    "## Hamiltonians in the plane wave basis\n",
    "FermiLib uses a third-party electronic structure package to compute molecular orbitals, Hamiltonians, energies, reduced density matrices, coupled cluster amplitudes, etc using Gaussian basis sets. However, this third-party electronic structure package has a restrictive GPL license. Accordingly, we cannot even mention it by name in this tutorial. While we provide scripts which interface between that package and FermiLib, we cannot discuss it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using simpler basis sets such as plane waves, these packages are not needed. FermiLib comes with code which computes Hamiltonians in the plane wave basis. Note that when using plane waves, one is working with the periodized Coulomb operator, best suited for condensed phase calculations such as studying the electronic structure of a solid. To obtain these Hamiltonians one must choose to study the system without a spin degree of freedom (spinless), one must the specify dimension in which the calculation is performed (n_dimensions, usually 3), one must specify how many plane waves are in each dimension (grid_length) and one must specify the length scale of the plane wave harmonics in each dimension (length_scale) and also the locations and charges of the nuclei. One can generate these models with function plane_wave_hamiltonian() found in fermilib.utils. For simplicity, below we compute the Hamiltonian in the case of zero external charge (corresponding to the uniform electron gas, aka jellium). We also demonstrate that one can transform the plane wave Hamiltonian using a Fourier transform without effecting the spectrum of the operator."

    "## Basics of MolecularData class and making a chemical series\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most useful features in FermiLib concern its interaction with open source electronic structure packages. Once again, we provide scripts to interact with one such package but cannot legally refer to it by name here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from electronic structure calculations is generated using scripts which perform the calculations and then populate a FermiLib data structure called MolecularData. Very often, one would like to analyze a chemical series or look at many different Hamiltonians and sometimes the electronic structure calculations are either expensive to compute or difficult to converge (e.g. one needs to mess around with different types of SCF routines to make things converge). Accordingly, we anticipate that users will want some way to automatically database the results of their electronic structure calculations so that important data (such as the SCF intergrals) can be looked up on-the-fly if the user has computed them in the past. FermiLib supports a data provenance strategy which saves key results of the electronic structure calculation (including pointers to files containing large amounts of data, such as the molecular integrals) in an HDF5 container.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MolecularData class stores information about molecules. One initializes a MolecularData object by specifying key parameters of a molecule such as its geometry, basis, multiplicity, charge and an optional string describing it. One can also initialize MolecularData simply by providing a string giving a filename where a previous MolecularData object was saved. One can save a MolecularData instance by calling the class's .save() method. This automatically saves the instance in a data folder specified during FermiLib installation. The name of the file is generated automatically from the instance attributes and optionally provided description. Alternatively, a filename can also be provided as an optional input if one wishes to manually name the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When electronic structure calculations are run using our scripts, the data files for the molecule are automatically updated. For instance, once one runs an FCI calculation on the molecule, the attribute MolecularData.fci_energy will be saved and set equal the FCI energy. If one wishes to later use that data they either initialize MolecularData with the instance filename or initialize the instance and then later call the .load() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis functions are based to initialization using a string such as \"6-31g\". Geometries can be specified using a simple txt input file (see geometry_from_file function in molecular_data.py) or can be passed using a simple python list format demonstrated below. Atoms are specified using a string for their atomic symbol. Distances should be provided in atomic units (Bohr). Below we initialize a simple instance of MolecularData without performing any electronic structure calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also demonstrate some functionality is the simple helper module, chemical_series.py. A chemical series is a progression of larger and larger molecules. Often, it is interesting to study chemical series because one can extrapolate the performance a method to a regime that is difficult to simulate. We demonstrate how two functions from chemical_series.py can be used make hydrogen rings or single atoms with the current spin multiplicity."

    "## Running psi4 to populate the MolecularData class\n",
    "\n",
    "The module run_psi4.py provides a user-friendly way of running psi4 calculations in FermiLib. The basic idea is that once one generates a MolecularData instance, one can then call psi4 with a specification of certain options (for instance, how much memory to use and what calculations to do) in order to compute things about the molecule, update the MolecularData object, and save results of the calculation. The most common calculations users will want in FermiLib would probably be self-consistent field (aka Hartree-Fock calculations). Our code uses these \"SCF\" calculations compute orbitals, integrals, Hartree-Fock energy, and more. Other common calculations are CISD and FCI calculations which also compute the 1-RDM and 2-RDM associated with their answers, CCSD calculations which also compute the CCSD amplitudes (useful for UCC) and MP2 calculations which can also be used to UCCSD initial guesses. \n",
    "Note that the \"delete_input\" and \"delete_output\" options indicate whether to save automatically generated psi4 input files or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is because psi4 has a GPL license that the only code which interacts with psi4 is run_psi4.py. In order to avoid license contamination we actually use python code to generate an input file for psi4 using psi4_template. Python code in psi4_template instructs psi4 (not python) to load the MolecularData object, populate it with information from calculations and then save the MolecularData object as a pickle or (eventually HDF5). The module run_psi4 uses subprocess to actually run_psi4 and then loads the pickled MolecularData. Let us look at a simple example where we compute the energy of H$_2$ at various bond lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warnings: electronic structure calculations are finicky. They sometimes fail for surprising reasons. If a particular calculation is not converging it is probably necessary to change some of the SCF options set in psi4_template. See the Psi4 documentation for more information or consult and electronic structure theory expert."

    "## InteractionOperator and InteractionRDM for efficient numerical representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular Hamiltonians can be expressed as $H = h_0 + \\sum_{pq} h_{pq}\\, a^\\dagger_p a_q + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{pqrs} h_{pqrs} \\, a^\\dagger_p a^\\dagger_q a_r a_s$ where $h_0$ is a constant shift due to the nuclear repulsion and $h_{pq}$ and $h_{pqrs}$ are the famous molecular integrals. Since fermions interact pairwise, their energy is thus a unique function of the one-particle and two-particle reduced density matrices which are expressed in second quantization as $\\rho_{pq} = \\left \\langle p \\mid a^\\dagger_p a_q \\mid q \\right \\rangle$ and $\\rho_{pqrs} = \\left \\langle pq \\mid a^\\dagger_p a_q \\mid rs \\right \\rangle$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both the RDMs and molecular Hamiltonians are both compactly represented and manipulated as 2- and 4- index tensors, we can represent them in a particularly efficient form using  similar data structures. The InteractionOperator data structure can be initialized for a Hamiltonian (or RDM) by passing the constant $h_0$ (or 0), as well as numpy arrays representing $h_{pq}$ (or $\\rho_{pq}$) and $h_{pqrs}$ (or $\\rho_{pqrs}$). Importantly, InteractionOperators can also be obtained by calling MolecularData.get_molecular_hamiltonian() or FermionOperator.get_molecular_operator(). The InteractionRDM data structure is similar but represents RDMs. For instance, one can get a molecular RDM by calling MolecularData.get_molecular_rdm(). When generating Hamiltonians from the MolecularData class, one can choose to restrict the system to an active space.\n",
    "\n",
    "These classes both inherit from the same base class, InteractionTensor. This data structure overloads the slice operator [] so that one can get or set the key attributes of the InteractionOperator: .constant, .one_body_coefficients and .two_body_coefficients. For instance, InteractionOperator[p,q,r,s] would return $h_{pqrs}$ and InteractionRDM would return $\\rho_{pqrs}$. It also supports binary operators !=, ==. Importantly, the class supports fast basis transformations using the method InteractionTensor.rotate_basis(rotation_matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "But perhaps most importantly, one can map the InteractionOperator to any of the other data structures we've described here. The generation of a QubitOperator representation of the InteractionOperator using the Jordan-Wigner transformation is shown below."
